# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a mobile-friendly, animated cafe website with an interactive 3D Home experience, a consistent contour-line theme, core informational pages, and an Export/Download page for a static package intended for later WordPress/Elementor use.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a Home page interactive 3D cafe room scene (React Three Fiber) with simple mobile/tablet and desktop controls plus a visible reset view control.
- Apply a consistent contour-line visual theme across all pages (cohesive non-blue/purple-default palette, readable typography, themed backgrounds/UI).
- Add sitewide smooth animations (page transitions, subtle UI hover/tap interactions, and at least one ambient 3D scene animation).
- Implement core pages with English placeholder content: Home, Menu, About Us, Contact Us (with a non-sending placeholder contact form behavior).
- Add an Export/Download page with a prominent download control for a single static archive (e.g., .zip) and clear English instructions for general WordPress/Elementor next steps.
- Add a persistent navigation header with a mobile-friendly menu and a footer with placeholder business details and links to core pages.
- Keep the app frontend-first; add minimal single-actor Motoko backend only if needed for export/download metadata/version info.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate a themed, animated cafe website, explore an interactive 3D cafe room on the Home page with easy mobile controls, browse placeholder Menu/About/Contact pages, submit a placeholder contact form, and download a static site archive from an Export/Download page with guidance for WordPress/Elementor usage.
